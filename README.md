# Heart Failure predictions

The goal of this project is to predict death events due to heart failure events. 
The project pipeline is built entierly on the AzureML ecosystem and relies on AutoML and HyperDrive to find and tune the best model.
The final model is deployed and an endpoint is available for real-time predictions.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

The [Heart Failure Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) Dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle.

> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

In this project we will train a classifier to predict the likelihood of a person to have a death event due to cardiovascular diseases.

In the image below we show a sample of the dataset we use

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

In order to access and use the data to train our models in the AzureML Studio we [create a Dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-register-datasets) reference, i.e. a `TabularDataset`, using the option *from a local file*

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

```python
automl_settings = {
    "task": 'classification',
    "iterations": 30,
    "experiment_timeout_minutes": 15,
    "primary_metric": 'accuracy',
    "training_data": dataset,
    "label_column_name": 'DEATH_EVENT',
    "n_cross_validations": 3,
    "max_concurrent_iterations": 8,
    "max_cores_per_iteration": -1
}
```
The settings used for the exploration of the model space with AutoML are quite limited in time and number of iterations to comply with the use of the 
workspace provided by Udacity. Nonetheless, to optimize computation speed we make use of concurrent iterations and maximum number of cores available.
Since we are tackling a classification problem, with a balancede dataset, the metric we want to optimize is the simple accuracy.
To train and evaluate the model we run a 3-fold cross validation. 

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

The best model generated by AutoML is a VotingEnsemble method that relies on a pre-trained `LightGBMClassifier` with a pre-processing .

![automl_accuracy](./screenshots/automl_accuracy.png)

The best model was obtained from the last run of AutoML and a larger search over the model space might improve performance. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
